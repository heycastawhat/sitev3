# sitev3 v3.0.4 fejoa
its a personal site with stuff what more would you want
built with HTML, CSS, JS, whatever randomness I felt like throwing in and code reused from sitev1 and v2 (if it works it works)

---
## How to run:

1. Pick your poison:
```npm run dev```
or
```yarn dev```
or
```pnpm dev```
or
```bun dev```
or just use live server in vscode

2. Go to localhost:3000 in your browser
3. Absorb the site and its information
4. Don't look at my messy code (optional)
